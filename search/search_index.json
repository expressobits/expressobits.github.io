After a long afternoon working and reading about MkDocs, I finally managed to put together a simple and static blog to keep everyone updated on the developments of Expresso Bits games, especially the new multiplayer game for Steam, Nevoa. I think few people don't know, but this project I've been doing is in Godot, I really gave up on Unity a long time ago and I imagine this is a topic for another post \ud83e\udd14.</p> Images of nevoa game. Ignore this UI, it's not final obviously <p>Soon I want to post some retroactive posts from the last few months of development with Nevoa. I'm really looking forward to creating a community and a survival game that's a good simulator of how to die \ud83d\udc80.</p> <p>I found it incredible how easy it is to create a blog in this system. I basically use markdown files, as if I were editing documentation for some open source library on GitHub.
